# WebScraperProject – Computer Networks

A Java Web Scraping Project using [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) to demonstrate network-based data extraction over HTTP. This project shows how a client program can connect to web servers, request HTML pages, and extract meaningful data programmatically.  

It’s a practical example of applying computer networks concepts, such as "HTTP requests, client-server interaction, and handling responses", using Java.

  - [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) – extracts book titles and prices.
  - [Example Domain](http://example.com) – extracts headings, paragraphs, and links.
- Demonstrates **HTTP requests and responses** using Jsoup.
- Handles multiple pages (pagination) for quotes and books.
- Saves scraped data to "CSV files" (`quotes.csv` and `books.csv`).
- Console output with "colored highlights" for better readability.
